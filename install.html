<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

Please follow the appropriate instructions for your operating
system. "20,000 Light Years Into Space" will run on any current-generation
PC.

<h4>Microsoft Windows</h4>

<p>If you are a Windows user, the self-contained EXE version of the
game will be the most convenient option for you. 
<a href="http://www.jwhitham.org.uk/biscuit_games/LightYears/">Download 
the ZIP file</a>, extract it, and run the EXE file within it.

<p>If you do want to run the source release, you must install the
Python and Pygame libraries.

<p>To install Python, visit 
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a>
and select the latest version of the Windows installer. Download the
installer, open it, and follow the on-screen instructions.

<p>To install Pygame, visit
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml</a>
and choose the Windows release. As before, download it, open it,
and follow the on-screen instructions.

<p>Once Python and Pygame are installed, the game is ready to run.
Click on the LightYears icon to start the game.

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>First, unzip the game into a convenient directory.
Ideally, the directory should be writable by you. There is no need
to install the game as root.
