This official version of Light Years continues to be managed by Jack 
Whitham, but it now includes code contributions and suggestions from a 
number of other people: 

* Cris Grada, who drew up some new graphics for the game,
* Siegfried-A. Gevatter, who maintains the Debian package, wrote the man 
  page, and contributed code to make the game suitable for Debian distribution. 
* Tom Dalton, who suggested the steam flow visualisation and a number 
  of other improvements, 
* Matthew Marshall, who contributed a patch for a different version 
  of the same visualisation feature, 
* Alexandru Toma, Terrence Brannon, Andrew Wilkinson, Neil Mitchell, 
  James Wells and Jillian who tested the game and provided bug reports. 
* Ivo Anjo, Enrico Zini, Denilson Sa, Matthew Scheffel and Jan Niemeyer 
  who sent in feature suggestions,
* Josh Holland, who suggested peaceful mode and provided a patch,
* Richard Jones, who organised the competition that inspired this game.

The following people have written patches which are not yet included,
but they deserve thanks nonetheless for their efforts:

* David M. Marti, 
* Anne Archibald, 
* Christoph Lucking.
