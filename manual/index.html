<p>20,000 Light Years Into Space is free software, licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>. If you don't
have a Windows computer, you can play the Source code version by installing
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 2.4 and 
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> 1.7 (or later
versions).

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p><b>1.3a</b> Replaced some sound effects with new versions.

<p><b>1.3</b> Repackaging for Linux distributions.

<p><b>1.2a</b> Source release only: Bugfix for 'SDL_ttf render failed'. 
There is no need to upgrade if 20K Light Years works on your machine.
Also, the game now stores savegames and configuration data in your home
directory (if you have one), and you don't need to run the game from
the game directory.

<p><b>1.2</b> <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame.org</a> release.
Includes various presentation tweaks.

<p><b>1.1a</b> Source release only: Pygame version detection bug fix.
No change to save file format or game rules.

<p><b>1.1</b> Includes many minor improvements, and one major change
that directly indicates flow. Thanks 
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/acidd_uk/">Acidd_UK</a> for this idea.

<p><b>1.0 (RC2)</b> Version handed in to Pyweek.
