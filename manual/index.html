<h3>Changes</h3>

<p><b>1.4</b> is a minor update to the game that introduces various
bug fixes, released ahead of a planned major update which is
currently in development:<ol><li>Changes 
    made by the Debian maintainer, Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals,
    are brought into the upstream version of the program. Thanks to 
    Siegfried-Angel for his long-standing support of Lightyears.
<li>Some new graphics, created by Cris Grada. Thanks Cris.
<li>Peaceful mode, where your network-building activities are undisturbed
    by the environment. 
<li>Fullscreen mode is no longer the default. If you want to play in
    fullscreen mode, you must run Lightyears with the --fullscreen parameter.
<li>Audio can now be muted inside the game without needing to specify
    a command-line parameter. (Though --no-sound still works.)
</ol>

<p><b>1.3a</b> Replaced some sound effects with new versions.

<p><b>1.3</b> Repackaging for Linux distributions.

<p><b>1.2a</b> Source release only: Bugfix for 'SDL_ttf render failed'. 
There is no need to upgrade if 20K Light Years works on your machine.
Also, the game now stores savegames and configuration data in your home
directory (if you have one), and you don't need to run the game from
the game directory.

<p><b>1.2</b> <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame.org</a> release.
Includes various presentation tweaks.

<p><b>1.1a</b> Source release only: Pygame version detection bug fix.
No change to save file format or game rules.

<p><b>1.1</b> Includes many minor improvements, and one major change
that directly indicates flow.

<p><b>1.0 (RC2)</b> Version handed in to Pyweek.
