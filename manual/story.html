<h3>The Story</h3>


<p>It is 1895 and you are a member of the British Space Expedition.
You receive the following letter from your long-time friend 
and leader, Sir Phileas T. Verne.

<p>
<blockquote>
    <i>The First of October, 1895</i>
    <p>My dear friend,
    <p>As you know, today we celebrate the opening of our first
    colony on the new world of Vaporia, some 20,000 light-years from
    England. Our colony is truly the most advanced structure that
    Science can create - a city on an alien world, entirely powered
    by steam from the planet's core. It has taken us five long years
    to get here by rocket-ship, and like the great Explorers before us,
    we shall make this foreign land our home: a new outpost of the Empire!
    <p>As my most trusted lieutenant, I leave you in sole charge of the
    new city, while I begin exploration of Vaporia. There is much to be done:-
    you must expand the city, but before you can do that, you'll have to
    secure better supplies of steam.
    <p>I wish you the best of luck, but must warn you that we may not be
    alone on Vaporia! I have detected evidence of civilisation here, so
    you may need to defend yourself. But I have faith in your abilities,
    my friend!
    <p>The steam must flow,
    <p>Yours,
    <p>(signature) Phileas T. Verne
